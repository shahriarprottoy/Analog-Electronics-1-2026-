Question 1
Difference Between n-type and p-type Semiconductor Materials

An n-type semiconductor is created by adding impurity atoms that have more valence electrons than silicon (such as phosphorus). These extra electrons become free charge carriers. Therefore, electrons are the majority carriers, and holes are the minority carriers.

A p-type semiconductor is formed by adding impurity atoms that have fewer valence electrons than silicon (such as boron). This creates empty spaces called holes. In this material, holes are the majority carriers, and electrons are the minority carriers.

In summary:

n-type → majority carriers are electrons

p-type → majority carriers are holes



Question 2
Forward Bias and Reverse Bias in a p–n Junction Diode

When a diode is forward biased, the positive terminal of the power supply is connected to the p-side and the negative terminal to the n-side. This reduces the width of the depletion region and lowers the barrier potential. As a result, charge carriers can cross the junction easily, and a large current flows.

When a diode is reverse biased, the positive terminal is connected to the n-side and the negative terminal to the p-side. This increases the width of the depletion region and strengthens the barrier potential. Only a very small leakage current (reverse saturation current) flows.

So:

Forward bias → large current

Reverse bias → very small current



Question 3
Meaning of “Ideal” in a Device or System

An ideal device is a theoretical model that behaves perfectly according to simplified assumptions. It does not include losses, imperfections, or non-linear effects.

For example, an ideal diode:

Conducts perfectly in forward bias (zero voltage drop)

Blocks completely in reverse bias (zero leakage current)

Switches instantly between states

In reality, no device is truly ideal, but ideal models help simplify analysis and calculations.



Reflection

In this assignment, I learned the physical difference between n-type and p-type semiconductors and how doping changes electrical behavior. I also understood how forward and reverse bias affect current flow in a diode.

The most challenging part was correctly applying the diode equation and managing the exponential calculation. It was important to carefully convert units (nanoamps to amps, Celsius to Kelvin). This assignment improved my understanding of semiconductor physics and diode operation.
